## What this course is

This course is a high-level introduction to design
systems. It will teach you the foundational skills your
team needs to build a set of reusable components and
standards.

## What this course is not

This course is not a comprehensive overview to design
systems. There is no industry-standard for what a
design system truly is, and as a result it can be
interpreted differently at different companies.
