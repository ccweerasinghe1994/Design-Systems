## Why do design systems matter?

### Accessibility

Everyone, regardless of
circumstance, should be able to
achieve the same results from
your application.

### Consistency

Your products should look and
feel like they're part of the same
brand identity.

### Trickle-down updates

The style can be updated in one
component within the system,
and will propagate to each
product .

### Responsiveness

Our web applications must
account for different screen
resolutions and devices.

### Onboarding

There is one place for new team
members to go to get all of the
information they need to get
started.

### Flexibility

A design system must serve a
variety of use cases, while setting
parameters on what exactly
those use cases can be.

### Speed

Once your design system has
been established, time to
production is greatly reduced.
